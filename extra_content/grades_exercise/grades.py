From the grades.csv file, read the data and produce a report card for each student.
    
    Part 1.     For each student, compute the overall percentage and print it.

    Part 2.     For each student, compute the overall percentage and write it to a file together with the grades.
                You should produce one file per student, and each file should be named after the student's name
                
                e.g. input:
                            grades.csv:

                            Max,70,67,80
                            Anna,100,54,70
                     output:
                            Max.txt:
                            Max | 70 | 67 | 80 | 217 | 72.33%

                            Anna.txt:
                            Anna | 100 | 54 | 70 | 224 | 74.67%
