# There are 36 possible scenarios when throwing a pair of dice.
# The possible sums are between 2 and 12.
# Write a program that creates a dictionary where the keys are the possible
# sums and the values are how many dice combinations can make that sum.
#
# For instance, the sum 2 can be achieved in one way only - both dice are 1.
# The sum 3 can be achieved in 2 ways - with combinations (1, 2) and (2, 1).
# The example output would be: { 2: 1, 3: 2, 4: 3, etc...}
