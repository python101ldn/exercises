# Create a variable called grade.
# Write an if statement, which will decide the mark a student will get based on their grade.
# If they get a grade higher than or equal to 60 - print 'Pass'.
# However, if they get a grade higher than 80 - print 'Distinction'.
# If their grade is lower than 60 - print 'Fail'.
